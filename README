Yet another OE board support layer for beaglebone

Currently we have already sources for beaglebone but they are missing:

This layer depends on:

URI: git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
branch: master
revision: HEAD

Send pull requests to openembedded-devel@lists.openembedded.org with '[meta-bbone]' in the subject'

When sending single patches, please using something like 'git send-email -1 --to openembedded-devel@lists.openembedded.org --subject-prefix meta-bbone'
